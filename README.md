# Employee Tracker

[Walkthrough Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pptHBw5KprhblyS2n2AVz5LuV7JmaqCi/view)

## Description
For this project, this is the first time I worked with a database to store information that persists. Even though it is not a deployed application,
the data will be stored locally on your machine. Employee Tracker is a great way for any company to manage their employees, roles, manager, and department name 
in a quick and easy to use node.js application.

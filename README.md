# Employee Tracker

check out the [Walkthrough Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pptHBw5KprhblyS2n2AVz5LuV7JmaqCi/view)

## Description
For this project, I used SQL with the mySql shell to make an employee tracker. This application uses raw SQL queries so that any business owner can keep track of their `departments` (by name and id) which has many `roles` (title, salary, department_id) which has many `employees` (id, first_name, last_name, role_id, manager_id)
